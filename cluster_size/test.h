/**
 * Tests the size of each cluster in terms of number of subclusters contained.
 *
 * Output:
 *  - For each timestep: The number of subclusters for each cluster, separated by a space.
 *      One LF at the end of the timestep.
 *  - The order of clusters is the internal order of the generator and is thus preserved over
 *      timesteps. Changes may however be caused by split and merge operations.
 *  - Output is given for NO_OF_TIMESTEPS timesteps.
 *
 * Further Parameters:
 *  - Number of individuals, n = 1000.
 *  - Home subcluster affinity, alpha = 0.5.
 *  - Probability of subcluster change of an individual, p_move_v = 0.1.
 *
 * @param k Number of subclusters.
 * @param l The value of l.
 * @param hhc Half-half coefficient. Passed to the AffinitiesGenerator.
